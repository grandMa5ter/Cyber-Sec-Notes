## Exploring Automated Tools

We download the winPEAS from the website and try to download that to the target PC:  
  
[https://github.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite/blob/master/winPEAS/winPEASexe/winPEAS/bin/x86/Release/winPEAS.exe](https://github.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite/blob/master/winPEAS/winPEASexe/winPEAS/bin/x86/Release/winPEAS.exe)

Within Meterpreter run this command:

`cd c:\windows\temp  
upload /root/Downloads/windPEAS.exe`

Then we try to run winPEAS.exe;   
Have that mind: _“winPEAS.exe” require a .NET framework of 4 and above which target doesn't have and so this doesn't work._
